## Getting help

1. Check the [README](README.md) and existing [issues](https://github.com/andresousadotpt/macskeleton/issues).
2. Search [closed issues](https://github.com/andresousadotpt/macskeleton/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).
3. Open a [new issue](https://github.com/andresousadotpt/macskeleton/issues/new/choose) with the appropriate template.

For bugs, include your macOS version, install method, and whether you used `make run` or the packaged app (`make app`).

## Common topics

| Topic | Notes |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Gatekeeper / "app is damaged"** | Expected for Homebrew and GitHub Release builds (ad-hoc signed). Right-click → Open, or build from source with `make app`. |
| **Tests fail to run** | `make test` needs full Xcode installed, not Command Line Tools alone. |
| **Bootstrapping a new app** | Follow the checklist in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); start with `packaging/app.env`. |
